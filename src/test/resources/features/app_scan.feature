Feature: Automated Application Security Scanning
  Run automated application level tests against the application using OWASP ZAP

  Background:
    Given a new scanning session
    And a scanner with all policies disabled
    And all existing alerts are deleted
    And the application is navigated
    And the application is spidered

  Scenario: The application should not contain SQL injection vulnerabilities
    And the SQL-Injection policy is enabled
    And the attack strength is set to High
    And the alert threshold is set to Low
    When the scanner is run
    And the following false positives are removed
      |url                    |parameter          |cweId      |wascId   |
    And the XML report is written to the file build/zap/sql_injection.xml
    Then no Medium or higher risk vulnerabilities should be present

  Scenario: The application should not contain Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities
    And the Cross-Site-Scripting policy is enabled
    And the attack strength is set to High
    And the alert threshold is set to Low

    And the following false positives are removed
      |url                    |parameter          |cweId      |wascId   |
    And the XML report is written to the file build/zap/xss.xml

    And the alert threshold is set to Low
    When the scanner is run
    And the following false positives are removed
      |url                    |parameter          |cweId      |wascId   |
    And the XML report is written to the file build/zap/ssi.xml

  @iriusrisk-cwe-94
  Scenario: The application should not contain Server side code injection vulnerabilities
    And the Server-side-code-injection policy is enabled
    And the attack strength is set to High
    And the alert threshold is set to Low
    When the scanner is run
    And the following false positives are removed
      |url                    |parameter          |cweId      |wascId   |
    And the XML report is written to the file build/zap/ss_code_injection.xml
    Then no Medium or higher risk vulnerabilities should be present

    And the Remote-os-command-injection policy is enabled
    And the attack strength is set to High
    And the alert threshold is set to Low
    When the scanner is run
    And the following false positives are removed
      |url                    |parameter          |cweId      |wascId   |
    And the XML report is written to the file build/zap/os_injection.xml
    Then no Medium or higher risk vulnerabilities should be present
